I’ve struggled in the past to complete ideas. I do think being able to spend a little time on it between things is going to be how I’ll inch closer to finishing them.

I’m thinking what if I have a series of small projects that add back up to a larger goal. Hashimoto wrote about this and build incrementally in this way has enabled him to build out many substantial software.

I believe my strength right now is rapid development in its early stages. If I’m able to choose a problem set where I know I can talk to a few people then that’s good enough for me.
