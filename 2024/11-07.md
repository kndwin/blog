I’ve done so many iterations of my blog that I realised it doesn’t really matter at this point  in time how it looks (right now as I write I’m using the default vitepress theme) and really just refining the process of thinking and writing.

I’d love to use this space as my corner to bash out ideas into more evolved forms so that I can iterate and build out some of them. I also want to recollect the deep rabbit holes I’ve encountered (from k8s auto scaling, to nixos vm, to bespoke sqlite syncs from browser to server and expo modules)

I feel as though I don't really commit to ideas and see what it looks like to polish them. I tend to start many things and struggle to be engaged enough on one thing to finish it. The ideas I had in the beginning were fun and exciting but after writing a bit of complexity, maintaining and extending it became a chore. I wonder if that's just how natural software evolves and the main aim really is to make it work well enough.

No real commitment for these blogs either, other than I want to try to write more so that I can self-correct if my ideas aren't up to scratch.
