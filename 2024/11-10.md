I remember playing fable 3 as a teenager and having to choose between losing a kingdom to an unknown force or losing people's trust by enlisting everyone to military service. I looked online and it turns out you can grind your way to have both outcomes if you just make lots of money. In some way I've made a similar choice with my life as I prepare for future big decisions like marriage and mortgages.

One way I've been thinking about moving to that direction is to build something for someone and have fun doing it. I think the last part is the hardest because it seems I have fun at the start and lose interest near the end. Generally though the simpler the mental model, the more fun it is to work in. And so I'm thinking deeply on building simple things well and not getting caught up in extending it to what I would love to use.

I have a few ideas but my time is limited these days and so I might try to build quickly and iterate instead. It's hard since my audience is myself so I want everything without wanting to pay the time for it but we'll see. I'd love to build a few complete and polished projects that would be good enough to garnish trust.
