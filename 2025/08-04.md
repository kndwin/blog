title: Start, Don't Perfect

I realize I get distracted really easily, and it's not even like a 20-30 minute problem—it's like 3-4 hours of doing nothing. I think part of it is because the tasks I imagine to be worthwhile feel quite hard to achieve, so I delay. I think I'd rather try a new approach where I just start, and I don't have to force myself to finish. I could just keep starting, with the feeling that it will keep getting easier.

It's probably why I'm trying to write as much as I can every day. It's easy because I don't have to actually type since my hand is in a cast—I just speak using dictation on my Mac, for the most part, as long as I feed it into Claude. There's room for error, which I'm actually really glad for.

I think I'm also really comfortable doing what I'm good at, but I'm really bad at doing the stuff I'm bad at. I realize I care a lot about doing it right the first time and not allowing mistakes. But really, mistakes are the pathway to doing it right. So I think I'm going to stop trying to perfect the process and just go through the process, keep going through the process. I don't have to achieve 100% efficiency—I just have to keep trying and getting better and better.
