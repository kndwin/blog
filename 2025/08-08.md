I recently hooked up the studio mic and I wanted to see if the quality of the microphone improved dictation, and I think in some sense it kinda does. I don't have to pronounce as strongly, but there's still a lot of typos that it doesn't really catch.

I've also set up the standing desk. I think it permanently stands, so it'll force me to be a bit more healthy. I think I'll see how my knees go and I'll stand a lot more often when I work anymoreâ€”not lie down and work. I think I'll just work when I stand or sit.
