title: Slowing down

I unpacked a little bit today, kind of a big deal for me because I could never really focus that easily. I've also shaved for the first time since my car crash three weeks ago. I think I'm trying to learn to just slow down. I have a need to hyper-optimize every moment. I think it's hard to slow down because I have this overwhelming fear that I might not have enough.

I think I'm hoping to just keep writing to force myself to slow down, at least for a moment. I'm  hoping that a collection of thoughts would form a clearer opinion on who I am and what I normally think about. Either way, I guess it's simpler than the previous diary that I used to write a lot. I think talking it out loud is actually quite nice. Anyway, it's probably what therapy would've been like.

On the technical side, I might rewrite what I did yesterday for Golang. Just so I know what I'm doing. I saw some pointers that confused me a little. It worked, so I didn't really worry about it, but I think it's actually better for me to just do it slowly rather than be good at Golang than to have another product that doesn't really work.
