## Work experience
### Sauce - Senior Software Engineer (Aug 2024 - Current)

#### **Infrastructure & Cloud Engineering (AWS CDK)**

- **Led a major infrastructure refactor using AWS CDK to provision a new, isolated "Recipe" microservice**, which included a new VPC, RDS database with a secure bastion host for debugging, and a full ECS deployment with an Application Load Balancer, ECR repositories, and CloudFront for content delivery.

- **Architected and implemented a robust, multi-stack CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions and AWS CDK**, enabling automated, environment-specific deployments for different services (e.g., recipe-app, application) and improving release velocity and reliability.

- **Engineered and integrated a production-ready ClickHouse cluster using AWS PrivateLink**, establishing secure, private connectivity between the ECS services and the OLAP database. Configured bastion hosts and security groups to allow for secure SSH and database connections.

- **Drove a significant architectural simplification by decommissioning the EKS cluster and removing Qdrant as a dependency**, reducing infrastructure complexity, operational overhead, and associated costs.

- **Enhanced system observability and alerting by integrating AWS Managed Grafana for monitoring and configuring AWS Chatbot** to send critical CloudWatch alarms directly to Slack, improving incident response times.

- **Scaled out the messaging and queueing infrastructure by provisioning multiple SQS queues via CDK** (e.g., FeedbackSyncIngestionQueue, CustomerSyncIngestionQueue, DeleteHighlightQueue), enabling more robust and decoupled asynchronous processing.

- **Implemented auto-scaling for the Kubernetes cluster by adding Karpenter to the Qdrant search service declaratively through AWS CDK**, optimizing resource utilization and cost-efficiency.

- **Assisted in enabling GPU instances for ECS to empower the machine learning service**, allowing the team to leverage more powerful models for data processing and analysis.

#### **Architecture & System Design**

- **Spearheaded the design and full-stack implementation of a "Graph of Thought" research agent**, a novel feature for complex, multi-step data analysis. This involved architecting new backend services, GraphQL APIs, database schemas with Drizzle ORM, and corresponding frontend components.

- **Drove a monorepo-wide refactoring to consolidate shared GraphQL schemas, types, and client configurations into a unified package**, significantly improving code reusability, type safety, and developer experience across the service, ui, and web-extension projects.

- **Designed a summary persistence system with MDX support**, allowing for the storage and retrieval of AI-generated summaries and enabling rich, formatted report rendering in the frontend.


#### **Backend Development & Performance Optimization**

- **Dramatically improved query performance for keyphrase trends by designing and implementing ClickHouse materialized views**, reducing query latency from minutes to seconds and offloading intensive analytical work from the primary Postgres database.

- **Improved Postgres performance by analyzing queries with EXPLAIN**, leading to targeted optimizations and schema adjustments that reduced query timeouts from over 60 seconds to under 5 seconds for critical data retrieval operations.

- **Implemented a Redis caching layer for frequently accessed data**, including highlight counts and trend run results, which reduced database load and improved API response times for key application features.

- **Refactored the Python-based machine learning services for improved performance and cost-efficiency**, transitioning from GPU-heavy sentence-transformer models to optimized OpenAI API calls for keyphrase extraction and topic generation.

- **Developed and secured a new API module with a comprehensive authentication and authorization layer**, enforcing user-specific data access through database migrations and service-level logic.

- **Enhanced the backend research agent by adding a dedicated post-processing step for formatting reports**, improving the quality, structure, and consistency of AI-generated output.

#### **DevOps & CI/CD**

- **Rolled out a semver release process using git tagging and GitHub Actions**, which automatically generated and published detailed release notes to Slack, improving transparency and communication across the organization.

- **Integrated the Claude AI into the CI/CD pipeline for automated code reviews**, helping to enforce coding standards, catch potential bugs, and improve overall code quality.

- **Configured and deployed OpenTelemetry across backend services**, enabling distributed tracing and providing deep insights into application performance and request lifecycles.

#### **Frontend Development**

- **Led a significant frontend modernization effort by upgrading the main UI to React 19**, refactoring numerous components to align with the new version's features while ensuring application stability and performance.

- **Championed the adoption of shadcn/ui and compositional patterns in the React codebase**, which reduced bundle size through tree-shaking and improved the maintainability and consistency of the user interface.

- **Built and launched a new "Personal Feed" UI**, providing users with a customized, dynamic, and engaging view of their data, complete with activity logs and trend visualizations.

- **Developed a feature-flagged, table-based view for browsing highlights**, offering users an alternative to the existing list view with enhanced sorting, filtering, and bulk-action capabilities.

- **Upgraded the Chrome extension to Manifest V3**, enhancing its functionality with new features and ensuring compliance with the latest browser standards.
